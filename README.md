<b> Inspiration </b>

Katrine, the designer of our team, is discalcular and has difficulties telling the time on a regular watch. She had an idea that would make it easier for her and others with discalculia to tell the time.

<b> What it does </b

The clock is shaped like a pie chart with two colors, a background color and front color. Instead of minute numbers, the front color indicates the time that has passed and the background color indicates the time that is coming. When the minutes of the hour is from 0-29 minutes, the clock shows the hour number of the time passed. But when the minutes of the hour is 30-59 minutes the clock shows the hour number of the time that is coming.

<b>How we built it </b>

The projects has been realised for three different platforms:<br>

Pebble Watch - with use of pebble-cloud sdk - Javascript - Rocky.js library<br>
Android Widget - native java application with use of Android Studio<br>
Android wear watchface - native java application with use of Android Studio<br><br>
